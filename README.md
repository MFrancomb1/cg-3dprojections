# 3D Projections for Wireframe Rendering

This project is a demonstration of the process of projecting a three dimensional object onto a two dimensional surface. There are several methods to do this, Orthographic projection results in a more mathematically correct model of an object but does not look realistic, and Perspective projections look more realistic at the expense of accurate edge lengths and angles. To demonstrate these projections, we can imagine a "camera" through which we will see the world. from this camera we can determine several important facts needed to prduce the objects, what direction is "up," what the camera is looking at, and the viewing area are some of these. Using these vectors we can calulate a position for each point of an object in 3d world space to be translated to 2d screen space.
